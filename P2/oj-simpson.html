        <h2>The Suspect - Orenthal James "O.J." Simpson</h2>
        <div id="accordion">
          <h3>The Early Years</h3>
          <div>
              <p>Orenthal James "O.J." Simpson was born on July 9, 1947 at Stanford University Hospital in San Francisco. At the age of 2, he contracted rickets and was forced to wear home-made
              braces on his legs until age 5. O.J. joined the Persian Warriors gang in 1960 and was briefly incarcerated at the San Francisco Youth Guidance Center in 1962. Following this brief stint
              in the correctional system, O.J. enrolled at City College in San Franciso and played football for them from 1965 to 1966. Due to his prowess, he was named to the Junior College All American
              team which helped him earn an athletic scholarship to University of Southern California in 1967.</p>
            </div>
          <h3>Adult Life - First Marriage (1967-1979)</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Much has been forgotten about O.J.'s much less infamous first marriage to Marguerite Whitley. The couple met at Galileo High School and began dating in 1965 and, once Marguerite turned
              18 in 1967, they married. O.J.'s football career was just beginning to take off, and during their marriage they spent the majority of their time in Amherst, New York while he
              played for the Buffalo Bills. They had three children over the course of their 11 year marriage, one of whom tragically died in a drowning accident in 1979. By 1977 there was trouble in paradise,
              and O.J.'s celebrity status was taking its toll on the marriage. It was during this tumultuous time that O.J. met Nicole Brown, who was working as a waitress in Los Angeles. O.J. and Marguerite
              separated in 1978 and were divorced by 1979.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Adult Life - Second Marriage (1985-1992)</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Nicole Brown was only 18 when she met O.J. in that Los Angeles restaurant, and despite the large age difference between the two, they married in 1985 and began reproducing almost immediately.
              The death of O.J.'s father, Jimmie Lee Simpson, in 1986 was bookended on each side by the birth of his two children; a daughter in 1985 and a son in 1988. While nobody can exactly say what
              went on behind closed doors in the Simpson household, what is known is that by January 1989 Nicole had ample reason to fear for her life. O.J.'s violent behavior led to a spousal abuse conviction
              where he was required to pay fines and make a charitable donation to a battered women's program, in addition to a 120-hour community service requirement. It seems that this did little good, however,
              as the couple were divorced by October 1992.

          <h3>The Murder - June 1994</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were brutally stabbed in Nicole's home. While the verdict has long since been read in this case, the validity of this ruling
              is under debate to this very day. Sometime between 9:35pm and 12:10pm an unknown assailant gained access to the home to commit the crime, and by June 14th the LAPD began their investigation
              by seizing clothing and belongings from the Simpson house.

          <p>
            Nicole Brown was born in May 1959 in Frankfurt, West Germany to Juditha Anne and Louis Hezekiel Brown. Her mother was German and her father American, and by the time Nicole reached high school
            the family had relocated to California. In 1977, when Nicole was 18, she was introduced to O.J. Simpson while working as a waitress in an L.A. nightclub called the Daisy. The couple began dating,
            despite the fact that O.J. was still legally married to his first wife, Marguerite. While he and Marguerite divorced in 1979, his marital status seemed unimportant to Nicole as their relationship
            culminated in marriage in early 1985. Sadly, the couple were unable to reconcile their differences and Nicole filed for divorce in February 1992. Friends claimed the couple were "dramatic" and
            "mutually obsessed" during both their relationship and subsequent marriage, so it seemed that the divorce was for the best.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although they were divorced, the couple still had to care for their 2 young children. O.J. and Nicole attempted to reconcile with one another, but were ultimately unable to come to any kind of agreement.
            It was during this tumultuous time that Nicole was brutally murdered in her own home.
