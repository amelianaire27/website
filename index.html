          <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>I bet you're wondering why I've brought you all here today. Is it for the live Twitter feed, you ask? No! Of course not!
            My aims are much more admirable. Of course, by admirable I mean completely self-motivated and self-gratifying.
            As you may have guessed, this site was carefully handcrafted by me, Amelia White. While it may not be a spectacle of graphics
            and sound, it will tell you a bit about me. Exciting, isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>All joking aside, this site has been constructed to showcase my various academic works, employment history,
            web programming assignments, and a brief personal history about myself. Below you'll find a recommendation
            written for me by one of my former managers.
          </p>
            <p>If you'd like to contact me in regards to an excellent book recommendation, website feedback, 
              or employment, you'll find a contact form on my <a href="education.html">resume</a> page which you can fill out. Any insights are welcome!
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>Rarely do you come across someone who is as curious and hard working as Amelia. During the time I 
              managed Amelia she was a consistently strong employee who was capable of taking on any task assigned to her. 
              She was hired on for data entry, but quickly moved up and progressed due to her excellent computer knowledge. 
               Along with her outstanding work ethic, skills and innovative ideas, Amelia is a pleasure to work with.
                Her upbeat personality and engaging energy make others comfortable around her and easy to work with. 
                No matter the task at hand, Amelia is the person for the job.</p>
